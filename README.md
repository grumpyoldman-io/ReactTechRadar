# React Tech Radar

A tech radar, built using React (Typescript) + Vite

## Install

1. run `yarn` to install dependencies
1. run `yarn dev` to start the local dev server

## Usage

Fill in your data in the `App.tsx` or fetch the data from your own source.

## Credits

This tech radar was built on top of [Zalando's Tech Radar](https://github.com/zalando/tech-radar), which in turn was developed based on the pioneering work by [ToughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). I merely converted it to a React project so it is a tad easier
to maintain for engineers working in React.
